## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you in setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can download Python from python.org and install libraries using pip.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. It consists of images labeled with various clothing accessories such as hats, sunglasses, ties, etc.

## Image Processing Techniques
Several image processing techniques are utilized to preprocess the images before model training. These techniques help in enhancing the features and quality of the images, making them suitable for training the neural network.

1. Image Resizing:

Images are resized to a uniform size to ensure consistency and efficiency during training.

2. Data Augmentation:
Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model.
Normalization:

Pixel values in the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to facilitate faster convergence during training.
## Model Training
The model training process is documented in the train_model.ipynb notebook. A neural network architecture based on TensorFlow is designed and trained on the preprocessed image data.

1. Neural Networks
Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons or units, organized into layers. Each layer performs specific operations on the input data and passes the results to the next layer, ultimately producing an output.

* Key Components of a Neural Network:
  1. Input Layer: The input layer receives the raw data or features that are fed into the neural network.
  2. Hidden Layers: Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They perform complex transformations on the input data through weighted connections and activation functions.
  3. Output Layer: The output layer produces the final predictions or outputs of the neural network.
  4. Connections (Weights): Connections between neurons carry information from one layer to the next. Each connection is associated with a weight, which determines the strength of influence one neuron has on another.
  5. Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax.
* Parameters of Neural Networks
  1. Number of Layers: The number of layers in a neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers. Deeper networks with more hidden layers can learn more complex representations but may also be prone to overfitting.
  2. Number of Neurons per Layer: The number of neurons or units in each layer of the neural network. This parameter determines the capacity of the network to represent and learn from the data.
  3. Weights (Parameters): Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons in different layers. They are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.
  4. Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to approximate complex functions and learn non-linear relationships in the data.
  5. Learning Rate: The learning rate controls the size of the updates to the network's weights during training. It determines how quickly or slowly the network converges to the optimal solution.
  6. Batch Size: Batch size specifies the number of training examples processed by the network in each iteration or batch during training. Larger batch sizes can speed up training but may require more memory.
  7. Epochs: An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. Training continues for multiple epochs until the network's performance stabilizes or converges.
  8. Optimizer: Optimizers are algorithms used to update the network's weights during training. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and AdaGrad.
  9. Loss Function: The loss function measures the difference between the predicted and actual outputs of the network. It serves as the objective that the optimizer tries to minimize during training.
  10. Regularization: Regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, 

2. Transfer Learning:

Transfer learning techniques may be employed to leverage pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet for feature extraction and fine-tuning.

## Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed information is available in the evaluation section of the train_model.ipynb notebook.

## Results
The final trained model is saved in the models directory. You can use it to make predictions on new images of clothing accessories.
